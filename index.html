        <h2>üëâAbout Money Heist</h2>
        <img src="money heist.jpg" alt="money heist" height="250px">
        <p><b>Money Heist </b>is a Spanish heist crime drama television series created by √Ålex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (√Ålvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo  The story is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on an unreliable narrator, flashbacks, time-jumps, and hidden character motivations for complexity. <br>The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fen√≥meno). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively.</p>

        <img src="Professor.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>The Professor, real name <b>Sergio</b>, was born in San Sebastian and mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was. His grandfather had fought against the fascists in Italy. He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled the heist through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator leading the case against the heist. Under the false identity of Salvador "Salva" Mart√≠n, he was able to get closer to the lead inspector assigned to the Royal Mint robbery, Raquel Murillo, and the pair eventually fell in love. Raquel then joins the gang by the name "Lisbon". He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement with the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of her poor memory and deleting the voicemail[clarification needed]. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldn't think of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be printed and the team to escape.

        <img src="Tokyo.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>Tokyo is a young thief on the run from the police after a failed robbery in which her boyfriend was killed. Her mother tried to hand her over to the police before she was involved in the heist, but later died of cardiac arrest, potentially from stress. She was hired by the Professor to help in carrying out a heist of the Royal Mint in Madrid. Together with the other seven robbers chosen for the heist, she is taken to a secluded villa where they plan the heist for five months. The Professor asks each of the robbers to choose a city name to hide their identities during the robbery and she chooses Tokyo. Tokyo is a flirty and rebellious character, and she has a relationship with Rio, that stops and starts throughout the first heist. She shares a good friendship with Nairobi, the two having gotten drunk together many times. She doesn't like being told what to do and shows dislike for Berlin in the first series.

        <img src="Berlin.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>La Voz de Galicia characterised Berlin as a "cold, hypnotic, sophisticated, and disturbing character, an inveterate macho with serious empathy problems, a white-collar thief who despises his colleagues and considers them inferior". Joana Oliveira of El Pa√≠s described Berlin in parts 1 and 2 as "obnoxious" and "a snob, a misogynist, and a bit sadistic" which La Vanguardia contrasted with the character's portrayal in the flashbacks in part 3, where he appeared "much more in love and cuddly". Actor Pedro Alonso described Berlin as "cruel, heroic, and funny at the same time" and saw Berlin's high observational skills and an unusual understanding of his surroundings, resulting in unconventional and unpredictable character behaviour.Although capable of empathy, Berlin often did not show it and was "deeply human and deeply ardent", causing chaos in his interactions with others. Alonso attributed Berlin's popularity to the character's desire to live and "enjoy everything at the moment intensely"living "life as a fantastic dream with great honesty, without abiding by conventions and morals".

        <img src="Nairobi.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>Before she was recruited by the Professor, Nairobi was an expert counterfeiter and forger, which she learned at an early age due to poverty. She had a son named Axel, of whom she lost custody after serving time in prison for drug trafficking and counterfeiting[1] She has become known for her energetic, charismatic, and motivational persona throughout the show. A born leader, she leads the hostages and her team with joy, passion, and enthusiasm as she uses her popular catchphrase "chikipum chikipum chikipum" (imitating a drum beat) to motivate them to work.
        In a team of hotheads and big egos, Nairobi is level-headed, focused only on accomplishing the job and maintaining peace within the group, and staying alive. She is well liked by the team and even the hostages; Mr. Torres, a hostage assigned to help her print the money in parts 1 and 2, praises her as the best boss he has ever had With her maternal instincts, she was able to sympathize with some of the hostages, such as motivating Alison Parker to stand up to her bullies and say the famous line "Soy la puta ama" ("I am the fucking boss").Throughout the show, Nairobi shows disgust over the excessive patriarchy on the team, questioning the leadership of Berlin and Palermo's offensive actions. In part 2, when she overthrows Berlin's leadership and temporarily takes control at the Royal Mint, she proudly declares "Empieza el matriarcado" ("Let the matriarchy begin"), a now iconic line for her character..

        <img src="Helsinki.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>Helsinki was born in Serbia. He was a soldier in the Yugoslav Wars with his cousin Oslo. He has a family in Serbia, to whom he sends money when he can.
        During the war, he had a bullet taken out of him in a tractor garage.
        The Professor recruits Helsinki in addition to seven other robbers, including his cousin Oslo. He was responsible for making the Professor's Seat Ibiza disappear after Tokyo and Rio used it to go to the Museum of the Factory. The Professor gave him with a thousand euros in order to pay the employees of the car junkyard to destroy it in front of him.    
        On Sunday 23 October, the Professor called the crew via the red telephone, to ask Helsinki if he had indeed destroyed the car. However, the car was actually still intact and in a scrapyard. Helsinki sent the money to his family and instead showed the Professor a photo of another car. This forces the Professor to leave his lair and go to the scrapyard in order to erase any evidence before the police arrive.

        <p>Rio was born in Getafe. His nickname given by his mother was Rayo, meaning lightning bolt in Spanish. At young age he became interested in computers and began programming at the age of 6.He often locked himself in his room for hours. His parents believed that he was working or playing on his computer, but he was actually beginning his career as a hacker.
        In 2010, he engaged in multiple cyber-attacks, which were all done discretely so the police couldnt track him. He stole banking data and attacked North American servers. These hacks were reported by several online newspapers such as La Voz, La Naci√≥n, El Diario.com, however his identity was never discovered

        <p>Denver was raised by his father Moscow, who abandoned Denver's mother at a roundabout due to her drug use. For many years, Moscow led Denver to believe that his mother abandoned him.
        Denver was one of the robbers participating in the Royal Mint of Spain heist alongside his father, Agust√≠n Ramos (Moscow). His father invited Denver to join the heist due some issues that he was having with traffickers.    
        During the heist, Moscow reveals the truth about Denver's mother, resulting in an argument and rift in their relationship. However, he is forgiven shortly afterwards when Moscow dies after being shot by police.

        <img src=" Moscow.jpg" alt="Professor" height="200px" width="170px">
        <p>His first job was a miner in Asturias. The job caused him to get silicosis, but what caused him to quit was claustrophobia, as he couldn't stand being in a small hole.[3] He later became a thief and was sent to prison several times.
        Little is known about Moscow's childhood, but we find out in Part 2 that when his son, Denver, was very young, his wife was struggling with a drug addiction. Moscow revealed that he left his wife at a roundabout to pick up her drugs, but left with Denver before she returned, and moved elsewhere.  
        He explains that he regrets that decision and went back many times to try and find her, but never did. He only told Denver the truth about this during Part 2; until then Denver thought his mother left them. Before beginning his criminal life of burglary, he used to be a miner, but it was revealed that he was claustrophobic and so left shortly after.    
        Moscow was also involved in other robberies before the Royal Mint robbery, and had served time before as seen in Part 1. He accepted the Professor's offer for the Royal Mint robbery to help Denver out after 800 pills he was holding for a dealer got stolen from his car, and help pay off his debt.

        <p>Raquel is an inspector for the National Police Corps tasked with negotiating with the robbers in parts 1 and 2. However, during the negotiations, she meets the Professor, who introduces himself to her in a bar under the name Salvador Mart√≠n, and embarks on a relationship with him. She falls in love with him to the point of choosing to follow him instead of arresting him, spurred on when she is embarrassed and shunned by her colleagues for bad decisions she made while in charge of the investigation.  <br>A year after releasing the professor, she follows him to the Philippines and becomes a member of the gang. Like the rest of the gang members, she takes the name of a city (Lisbon) to hide her identity.
